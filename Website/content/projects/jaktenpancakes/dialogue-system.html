<h4>Dialogue System</h4>
<p>
  At the outset of our project, we initially planned to implement a dialogue and
  romance system only if we had a preliminary draft before the alpha stage
  concluded. I was particularly <strong>enthusiastic</strong> about this feature
  and felt compelled to swiftly create a first draft for the team to demonstrate
  its feasibility.

<p>
  Working closely with
  <a href="https://tovelaursen.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Tove</a
  >, we collaboratively developed a dialogue system that also incorporated
  various endings based on the player's choice of romantic interest.
</p>
<p>
  Utilizing an unordered map, we efficiently mapped character emotions to
  dialogue lines, allowing for dynamic expression changes during conversations.
  Additionally, we introduced dialogue choices and responses, enabling players
  to shape interactions.
