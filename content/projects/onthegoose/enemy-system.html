<h4>Enemy System</h4>
<p>
  In this project, the enemies are turret-like units that fire arrows behaving
  like hitscan projectiles. To simulate pressure without unpredictable unfair
  spikes, we use an invisible pursuing orb that constantly chases the player.
  When it reaches the player, damage is applied and the orb resets to its
  starting slot in a path/list. This works like a soft timer that rewards
  momentum: the orb's speed and tether distance scale dynamically with the
  player's current velocity.<br><br> The enemy accuracy system is intentionally tuned
  for immersion: as the player moves faster, aim cone error widens so shots
  visually "miss" more often, reinforcing a feeling of narrowly dodging rather
  than pure RNG. This keeps combat readable while supporting the parkour focus.
