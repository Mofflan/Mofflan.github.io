<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>
  As part of my responsibilities, I led the development of the player
  controller. This included fine-tuning movement and rotation mechanics and
  setting up a smooth state machine to handle different player actions
  seamlessly.I also the added dynamic animations to make the character's
  movements feel more natural and responsive. In addition to these main tasks, I
  pitched in with other features to make sure the gameplay experience was
  immersive and complete.
