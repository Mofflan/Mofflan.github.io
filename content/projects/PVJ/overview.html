<h4>Team Leader</h4>
<p>
  During my internship, I was promoted to Team Lead, where I managed a
  cross-disciplinary team of approximately 10 members, including programmers,
  2D/3D artists, and technical artists. My responsibilities included
  coordinating tasks, conducting code reviews, and ensuring effective
  communication among team members. This role allowed me to develop my leadership
  skills and gain valuable experience in managing a diverse team. </p>
