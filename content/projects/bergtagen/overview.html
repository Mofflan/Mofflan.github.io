<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>
  For our final school project, we decided to switch from our custom engine to
  Unreal Engine. This decision was made collectively, as we believed it would be
  beneficial to gain experience with Unreal Engine, which is widely used in the
  gaming industry.<br><br> In this project, my contributions included developing
  procedural animations for the player, creating a rotating character animation,
  and implementing an interactive arm. Additionally, I restructured the enemy
  control rig to enhance its readability. I also worked with AngelScript to
  incorporate night vision functionality.
