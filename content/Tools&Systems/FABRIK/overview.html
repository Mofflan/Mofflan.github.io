<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>
  At The Game Assembly, students take a course called Specialization, where they
  choose an area of focus to explore in-depth. For my specialization, I chose
  procedural animation, specifically using the FABRIK (Forward and Backward
  Reaching Inverse Kinematics) method.<br><br> My original plan was to create a
  procedurally animated spider in Unreal Engine. However, I ran into significant
  challenges with rigging and engine compatibility. After struggling for a few
  weeks, I decided to switch to Unity, which proved to be a more manageable
  environment for my project.
